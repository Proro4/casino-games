                <ol class="columns-2">
                  <li>
                    Our goal is to be a fun place to play, where everyone can
                    feel comfortable. As such, we will not tolerate vulgarity.
                    All our players' chat needs to be clean and respectful.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Please note: Game Chat is a privilege, not a right. It does
                    NOT affect your ability to earn and/or stop you from playing
                    at Pasino.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The game chat is a community chat that you are logged into
                    once in the site.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The game chat is moderated to prevent spamming, griefing,
                    trolling, begging, unsought links, excessive behavior and
                    violations of rights and freedoms. The game chat is easier
                    with the help of our moderators and ALL content is stored on
                    our servers for review at any time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There are a number of chat rules with penalties for each
                    type of violation depending on the severity and recurrences.
                    Anytime we conduct a review, we consider the user's account
                    history and previous infractions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    WARNINGS: If you are warned. Please do not keep pushing the
                    mods, as after so many chances you will be MUTED.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    MUTES: If you are muted, it is max 120 hrs. Consider this a
                    cooldown period.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ACCOUNT SUSPENSION: This should be self-explanatory. These
                    are permanent. Do not get on the ban list as this includes
                    complete lockdown of the account.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <div class="divider"></div>

                <p>
                  NOTE: Warnings and Mutes do not affect you playing and
                  collecting. It only blocks you from game chat.
                </p>

                    Profanity/Abuse: Profane, vulgar, racist or
                    abusive/insulting chat. Do not engage in retaliatory chat,

                    Begging/solicitation: Asking for coins, rains and/or but not

                    Non-English chat (some exceptions apply): We are aware that
                    our players are from different backgrounds and that for many
                    of them English is not their first language. However, at
                    this time our policy is that English is the only language
                    allowed in the English chat. If English is not your first
                    language, please switch to the appropriate channel.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Commercial Use: It is strictly prohibited to use chat for
                    any commercial gain whatsoever, including making any
                    statements which promote any third-party services or
                    products.

                    Buy/steal existing users: Offering incentives to re-register

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Malicious behaviour: Chat cannot be used for any malicious
                    or offensive behaviour, including but not limited to
                    collusion, fraud or spam. Users shall not make statements
                    about our site that are untrue or would reasonably be
                    considered to be derogatory or critical. Users should be
                    generally aware of the feelings of other customers and
                    staff, and should act in a respectful manner.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Stalking/harassment: To harass, abuse, intimidate and
                    intentionally disrupt the game is prohibited. We will
                    investigate any such reports. When sending a report of this
                    kind always include the user's name of the person reported
                    and approximate dates and times, and video/photo proof as
                    well as the subject Chat Stalking Complaint - Attn: Stalking
                    Team.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When we examine a chat complaint, we look at all chat
                    involved, as well as context. We take appropriate action in
                    all cases where a player is in violation of chat rules.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We reserve the right to change, alter and/or update the
                    rules as needed, thus if a situation arises where staff have
                    to get involved REMEMBER staff have the final say.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If reported players are still chatting, then they were
                    either considered to be not abusive, or given a warning,
                    rather than having their chat suspended.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Keep religion/politics chat to a minimum. The chatroom is
                    made to help the community find players, reconnect with lost
                    players, discuss games and ask for assistance on issues
                    regarding the site. Starting topics on religion and politics
                    is just asking for trouble/arguments.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do not try to get around the filters. If you continuously
                    try, you will be removed from chat.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do not argue publicly with the mods. If you donвЂ™t like how
                    they moderated something or are concerned with how something
                    was done, talk with them privately. If it still goes
                    unresolved, send an email to our support team.
                  </li>
                  <li>No hate speech of any kind is allowed.</li>
                  <li>
                    No advertising of outside games or websites that do not
                    pertain to our platform unless expressed permission by staff
                    is granted.
